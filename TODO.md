- **Rationale**: AI personal trainer should be central from Day 1, not an afterthought
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented in current todos

### **üìä Data Strategy Decision**
- **Decision**: Supabase chosen over Firebase for production scalability
- **Rationale**: 
  - **PostgreSQL**: More powerful for complex fitness data relationships
  - **Row Level Security**: Better data isolation and security model
  - **Real-time subscriptions**: Perfect for AI coaching and live workout tracking
  - **SQL flexibility**: Complex queries for progress analytics and AI insights
  - **TypeScript integration**: Auto-generated types for better developer experience
  - **Cost effectiveness**: Better pricing for production scale
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented and configured with complete schema

### **üéØ User Journey Prioritization**
- **Decision**: User data collection moved to immediately after language selection
- **Flow**: Language ‚Üí User Profile Setup ‚Üí AI Assessment ‚Üí First Workout Generated
- **Rationale**: Need user data early for AI personalization effectiveness
- **Status**: üöß Next implementation priority

### **üí™ Workout Progress Tracking Design**
- **Decision**: Exercise completion with loading bar visual feedback
- **Flow**: User marks exercises as complete ‚Üí Progress bar fills ‚Üí Save to "My Workouts"
- **Rationale**: Clear visual progress motivates users during workouts
- **Status**: üìã Designed, pending implementation

### **ü§ñ AI Interaction During Workout**
- **Decision**: Real-time AI coaching with contextual guidance
